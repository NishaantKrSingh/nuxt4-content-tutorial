## What are Webhooks?
Webhooks are a way for applications to communicate with each other in real-time. They allow one application to send data to another application when a specific event occurs. This is typically done via HTTP POST requests.

## How Do Webhooks Work?
When an event occurs in the source application, it triggers a webhook that sends a payload of data to a predefined URL (the webhook endpoint) in the destination application. The destination application can then process this data and take appropriate actions based on the information received.

## Setting Up a Webhook
To set up a webhook, you typically need to follow these steps:
1. **Create a Webhook Endpoint**: This is a URL in your application that can receive and process incoming webhook requests.
2. **Register the Webhook**: In the source application, you need to register your webhook endpoint and specify the events that should trigger the webhook.
3. **Handle Incoming Requests**: Your webhook endpoint should be able to handle incoming HTTP POST requests and process the data accordingly.
