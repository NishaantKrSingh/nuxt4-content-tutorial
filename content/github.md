## Introduction to Git and GitHub
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code and collaborate with others. GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration, code review, and project management.    

## Setting Up Git
To start using Git, you need to install it on your computer. You can download Git from the official website: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). After installing Git, you can configure your username and email by running the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"
```
